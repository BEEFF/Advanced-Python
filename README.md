# ADVANCED PYTHON

This repo contains purely Python code snippets and learning materials for advanced pythons. I have simplified the information found in https://docs.python.org/. 

All code is written in Python 3.8.10, I have supplied a virtual environment for you to activate (source venv/bin/activate) in order to run all the snippets. 

If you have any topics you want me to cover please raise an issue! 

## Topics
